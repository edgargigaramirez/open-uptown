                <ol>
                    <li>Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.</li>
                    <li>Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.</li>
                    <li>Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.</li>
                    <li>Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.</li>
                    <li>Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language
                        such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”</li>
                    <li>Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.</li>

                        civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized
                        groups.</li>

                        and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</li>
                    <li>Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.</li>

                <p>Open Uptown reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Open Uptown

        <h3>Open Uptown's Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>
        <p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the
            <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy" target="_blank">example policy</a> from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>All Open Uptown events, and digital forums and their participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included
            below.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Open Uptown will only lend our brand and fund groups that
            offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy
            to your group, see
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zg2FDt7awgfCmdcbzMwKHMb1A7KDOhs_z7ibCb3TLLQ/edit" target="_blank">this guide</a>.</p>

        <p>Open Uptown is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity
            and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do
            not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
            appropriate for any Open Uptown event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies
            may expelled from Open Uptown network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event
            organizer or forum administrator.
        </p>

        <p>Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity
            and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images
            in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained
            disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted
            exclusion; and patronizing language or action.</p>

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
            warning the offender or expulsion from Open Uptown network activities, events, and digital forums.</p>

        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify
            an organizer immediately. You can contact us at info@uptown.codes or @ryan-koch / @csethna on Slack. Event staff
            or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or
            otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>

        <p>If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove
            yourself from the situation.</p>

        <p>You can also contact Open Uptown about harassment at safespace@codeforamerica.org and feel free to use the email
            template below. Open Uptown staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation
            due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by
            providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide
            an environment that is welcoming to all.</p>

        <p>We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free
            environment.
        </p>
